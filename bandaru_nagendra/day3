
Day 3 git commands

still we have practiced single file cretion or single directory.

in Day 3 we will do multiple files and folders we will create in our Central or local repo.

touch filename fname fname fname

ex: touch prod preprod demo tst --> one file to other file add one space.

same for directory also

ex: mkdir prod preprod demo tst

--------------------------------------------

How to clone central repo

git clone "URL"

once you have cloned central repo use below cmd for select central repo.

cd "central repo folder or directory name"

now we will do one actiity to push files into the central repo

create file: touch "file name" --> file name shoud be single name with out spaces.

check status of your file: git status --> created file should be in red color it means untacked file.

add your newly created file into the Workspace: git add "file name"

If you want to add all the existed files in that folder or branch, use (git add .)

next we need to commit tacked files 

git commit -m "message and why you are commited your file into the staging/indexing"

incase you want to do single file means you need to add file name like below

git commit -m "message" filename

ex: git commit -m "this is my first file" tst.

to findout your git cid"commit id"

use cmd: git log

to view the changes 

use cmd: git show cidnumber

till now we did the all changes in our virtual repo and now time is push the all changes into the central repo.

cmd: git push --> this will do the all your files or directorys will sync into the central repo.

cmd: git pull --> this will help you to rebase your virtal local repo upto date or it will sync missing or newly added files will sync.
